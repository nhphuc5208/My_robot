- Robot capable trajectory planning, self moving to destinationg and avoid obstacles. Using LiDAR sensor to scan enviroment, and create map.
- Programming STM32 with C launguage, using STM32CubeMX to config and using KeilC to programming for control servo motor with PID algorithm, communicate between STM and ROS.
- STM32 use Timer interrupt, Timer PWM, UART DMA, Flash memory.
